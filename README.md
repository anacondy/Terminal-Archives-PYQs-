# Terminal-Archives-PYQs-
A complete, self-contained website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It is a "front-end only" application, meaning it runs entirely in the user's browser without needing a server or a database connection.  The code is organized into three distinct files: index.html (structure), style.css (design), and script.js (functionality)

FEATURES 

Authentic Terminal UI: A dark-themed, text-based interface that mimics a real command-line terminal, complete with color-coded prompts and text.

Animated Progress Bar: A dynamic loading bar that appears during simulated tasks like "initializing" and "searching" to enhance the user experience.

Paper Database & Search: A built-in (currently sample) database of previous year papers. Users can press Ctrl + K to instantly bring up a search box and filter through the papers.

Device Information Scan: On startup, the site performs a scan and displays browser-accessible information about the user's device (CPU cores, approximate RAM, browser storage).
